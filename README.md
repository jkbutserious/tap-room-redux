# Tap Room Redux

#### React and JavaScript Functional Programming Exercise for Epicodus, 09.11.2020

## By Jeff Kim

## Description

It's been a long week learning functional programming and now it's time to go grab a cold one with your team. But wait! Turns out the local tap room system has crashed and now we need to design a new system that can help them keep track of their stock.

This project uses React to dynamically update a single-page app that will allow users to add a new keg to a master list, click a keg to see its details, click a button that will sell a pint of that keg and keep track of the pints remaining, and restock a keg so that it will be full again.

## Specifications

| Behavior | Input | Output |  Completed(Y/N?)  |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| Create a keg object | Click **Add Keg** button | A new keg object is instantiated | Y |
| Add the new keg object to a master list | N/A | Keg is added to the master list of kegs and displayed on the page | Y |
| Click a keg to see its details | Click a keg div on the master keg list | Load keg details component | Y |
| Sell a pint and decrement the pints left value | Click the **Sell a Pint** button | Pints left value decrements by 1 | Y |
| Display a message when a keg is out of stock | Click the **Sell a Pint** button until the pints left value is 0 | Display a message "This keg is empty" | Y |
| Refill a keg | Click the **Restock this keg** button | Pints left value is reset to 124 | Y |

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
